 I worked tried to get rid of that damn noMatch from showing up on my pages but I cant. So instead
I decided to work on getting a button to work to show the next page of beers. It looks like 
complete garbage but hey, its essentially working. I would have used scroller but I could not get 
it to work at all.
 Just got it to only show 5 entries each time that i click on the button to show more beers!!! 
woot.
